# Curated_Repository

A selection of some programs I've written over the course of my research that were particularly challenging or interesting.

1. Implementation of Frontier based BDD construction algorithms: 

a. For simple paths: https://github.com/LorenzoNajt/TinyProjects/blob/master/ConnectedPartitionSampling/BDD/SIMPATH.py

b. For connected partitions: https://github.com/LorenzoNajt/TinyProjects/blob/master/ConnectedPartitionSampling/BDD/Flats.py

(Note: These were extremely finicky to code correctly. I ended up validating them against OEIS, but I'd like to find a better system if I have to program something similar in the future.)

2. Algorithm to find the dual of a plane graph: https://github.com/LorenzoNajt/TinyProjects/blob/master/MarkovChains/Facefinder.py

3. Coming soon: Numba optimized implementations of various Markov chains on connected partitions.
